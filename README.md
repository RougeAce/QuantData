# QuantData

This is an application that uses the internet to pull data about differnet investment stratgies and types. It rellies on many open source projects such as yfianace and APIS
such as FRED and CoinBase's. Currently its in Pre-Alpha and I plan on having an Alpha version done by May 31. I could use any amount of help, but my goal is to create a tool
that I can use to quickly anaylise data about anything to do with the economy and finance. The goal is to make this as customizeable as possible, which means people should be 
able to make their own UIs. As you guys can guys can tell from reaidn this README I am new and will need a lot of help.
